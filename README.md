- Key features of the app include:

* Search Functionality: A search bar in the header enables users to filter products dynamically.
* Cart Management: Users can view the total cart value, add products, and adjust quantities (increment/decrement) in real-time.
* Product Sorting: Products can be sorted by various attributes such as models, brands, and custom criteria, enhancing user navigation and experience.
* Product Details: Clicking on any product displays detailed information, providing users with in-depth insights about the selected item.
* The app utilizes Redux Toolkit for state management, ensuring scalability and ease of handling complex states. To maintain state across sessions, Redux Persist is implemented, allowing the cart and other critical data to be saved in local storage.

This project has been a valuable experience, providing insight into efficient state management, component testing, and optimized frontend performance.
